## Summary 

While the website was created, the filter function did not properly work. The code reqyires debugging. Attempted to add a button to the code, but filter still did not work.

A potential drawback of the code may be that the filters are case-sensitve. Additionall all field may need to be filled in order for the filter feature to function. 

It may be benefical to create date ranges instead of searching by date.
